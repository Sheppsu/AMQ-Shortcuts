# AMQ-Shortcuts
Right now it's just two shortcuts:
- ctrl + s: Presses the skip button.
- ctrl + shift + s: Switch between chat box and answer box. Will default to chat box if neither is currently in focus.

# How to install
1. Have tampermonkey or some extension that can run the script (not sure if anything other than tampermonkey works).
2. Click [here](https://github.com/Sheppsu/AMQ-Shortcuts/raw/main/script.user.js) and tampermonkey should prompt you to install it. If no prompt appears, you can either copy paste the code into a new script or use import from URL under utilities on the tampermonkey dashboard.
